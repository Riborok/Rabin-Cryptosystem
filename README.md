# Rabin Cryptosystem
___

This project implements the Rabin cryptosystem, a public-key cryptosystem that is based on the difficulty of integer 
factorization. It offers encryption and decryption functionalities using the Rabin algorithm for binary files. 
The project also includes tests for specific values of p, q, and b, ensuring unambiguity decryption (first launch 
might be time-consuming, as it involves creating a binary file of prime numbers with a remainder of 3 when divided 
by 4).
